Text: In order to promote Raw Art Works 25th anniversary and fundraising campaign we needed to create an identity system that celebrated and reflected the institution and community that RAW has become and what it dreams of growing into. After a long process of trial and error we landed on this watermark motif because it has the qualities of growth, expansion, celebration, and motion. For the campaign website we also wanted to use motion as our guiding principle and present stories that will move people to help RAW grow so it can accept more kids who are eager to join their programs. Jason Pescione developed the smooth interactions!
