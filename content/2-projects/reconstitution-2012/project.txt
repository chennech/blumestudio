Text: ReConstitution2012 was a self-funded Sosolimited art project which analysed the speech of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential debates. The language used by the candidates generated a live typographical map of the events. Algorithms tracked the psychological states of Romney and Obama and compared them to past candidates. I was involved with designing and helped with the front-end development of the site. You can replay the debates and see the analysis at Recon12.com
