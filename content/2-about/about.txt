Blume Studio is a multi-discipline design and visual communication studio based in San Francisco. We strive to create meaning in our work by starting with understanding the essence of each project rather than styles and fads. We love technology but believe that the most important part of the design process is in the making and thinking with our hands first. Our best work has come from collaborating with clients who share our drive and passion for exceptional design and user experience. 

Chen Blume was born in Tel Aviv Israel.  In Hebrew Chen means charm and beauty and the "Ch" is pronounced like the "ch" in Bach (the composer). She received a BFA from the graphic design department at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Chen is a also a co-founder of Specctr App. She has worked on multi-faceted projects that range from print, web, UX to art installations. When sheâ€™s not designing Chen enjoys biking, yoga and hand made crafts.
